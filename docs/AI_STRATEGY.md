# DevTrack360 - AI & LLM Integration Strategy

This document defines the strategy for integrating AI and Large Language Models (LLMs) into the application.

## Phase 1: MVP AI Features
The initial goal is to enhance the core user experience by automating repetitive tasks.

1.  **AI-Powered Issue Triage:**
    - **Goal:** Automatically suggest a priority level and relevant labels when a new issue is created.
    - **User Story:** "As a project manager, when a new issue is created, I want the system to suggest a priority based on the issue's description so I can triage tasks faster."
    - **Implementation:** Use the OpenAI API to analyze the issue text and recommend `priority` and `labels`.

2.  **Duplicate Issue Detection:**
    - **Goal:** Prevent redundant work by flagging potential duplicate issues upon creation.
    - **User Story:** "As a developer, when I create a new issue, I want the system to warn me if a similar issue already exists so I can add my comments to the existing one instead."
    - **Implementation:** Use vector embeddings and semantic search to find and display similar issues in real-time.
